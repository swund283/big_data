There are significantly more non-account reviews than there are account related reviews.  However, I feel that overall the reviews are trustworthy.  When you look at the total average review by account status you see a similar average.  And the curve of 1- 5 stars does not look that different.  In addition, the ratio of total votes to helpful votes is similar.  Overall, nothing stands out from this dataset that make me question the overall trustworthiness of the reviews.
